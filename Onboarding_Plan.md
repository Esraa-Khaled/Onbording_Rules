## 1. 📅 Work From Home (WFH) - Work From Office (WFO) Alignment

- Every member must be **available at the office at least 12 days per month**.  
- Notify on Slack if you plan to work from home **the day before**.  
- At the end of each day, submit your request **after completing your timesheet**, and attach a snapshot of your timesheet in the request.  
- The timesheet should **contain evidence of work done**, including a brief description of your activity if your ticket is not yet finished.  
- If additional work is needed, **update the ticket with a patch of code or relevant progress**.  
- To ensure everyone completes the **minimum 12 WFO days**, requests will only be approved **at the end of the month** or when each member meets their WFO requirement.  
- **Vacation days are not deducted** from office days.

## 2. 🕓 Support & Escalation Model

- Support is actively monitored during the hours listed below. Outside these hours, response times may be slower. we should align expectations accordingly.

### Support Rules
- Developers should escalate **after 15–30 minutes of blockage**.  
- Issues must include:
  - Problem description  
  - Steps attempted  
  - Error messages/logs  

### Available Time
- I will be available for support for **1.5 → 2 hours per day**:  
  - **11:30 AM – 12:00 PM**  
  - **4:30 PM – 5:00 PM**  
- Outside these hours, send a message and I will respond according to the **Response SLAs**.

### Response SLAs
- **Office days:** 5–10 minutes  
- **WFH days:** ≤ 15 minutes

# 🔧 How to handle Support Tickets

## 🧭 Strategies to Manage High Volume of Support Requests

### 1. 🚫 No Direct Messages or Emails
- Support **must go through official tickets only**.  
- If someone contacts a developer directly, politely ask them to open a ticket.  
- **Exception:** P0 issues may be handled immediately, but a ticket must be opened afterward.  
- ⚠️ **No Git push is allowed without a ticket reference.**

### 2. 👥 Limit Developer Disruption
- Only **assigned weekly supporters** handle support tickets.  
- Other developers focus on tasks.  
- If another developer is required, the supporter involves them **with prior agreement**.

## 3. 📋 General Notes

- Bugs that require development: create a **bug request**, include the **bug ID** in the support ticket, then close the support ticket.  
- Requests for **non-existing actions** should be redirected to the **business team**, then the support ticket should be closed.  
- Supporters should focus **only on support-related tasks**.  
- Support meetings with the requester **must not exceed 30 minutes** to understand the scenario. If more time is required, **escalate the issue**.
